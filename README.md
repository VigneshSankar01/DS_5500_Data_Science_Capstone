This project aims to solve the complexities of managing heterogeneous patient populations using the NHANES dataset containing comprehensive health, nutrition, and lifestyle information. The project's intent is to leverage clusters of patients into clinically meaningful groupings that can assist providers in anticipating risk, lessening expensive hospital readmissions, and moderating care delivery. The clusters will significantly represent the real-world health profiles that assist with decision making on an individual and population basis.

To accomplish this, our plan will use individual patient patterns to inform groupings that will be distinct in terms of health, and then construct a recommendation system that assigns patients to the most relevant health grouping. This will help providers understand which types of care work best across many patients and allow them to provide clear and actionable recommendations to other patients receiving similar treatment. The ultimate outcome of this project is a tool that organizes and accounts complex data into digestible information, allowing healthcare systems to provide better service that incorporates innovative patient care based on behavioral responses, more personalized care, and ultimately more efficient use and allocation of those resources.
