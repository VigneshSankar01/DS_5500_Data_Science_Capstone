    "Although the patient is formally assigned to **Cluster 6**, their actual clinical presentation shares multiple characteristics with the generally healthier **Cluster 0** profile. The model’s assignment reflects proximity in the UMAP latent space, but the patient’s original health features—including normal metabolic markers, absence of chronic disease conditions, and stable cardiovascular indicators—more closely resemble the low-risk phenotype typical of Cluster 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, the system can be used not only to interpret cluster membership but also to **extend treatment and screening recommendations across clinically similar clusters**. In this case, clinicians may choose to review **Cluster 0’s preventive care guidance**, early-screening suggestions, and risk-management strategies as potentially relevant for this patient.\n",

    "This does **not** suggest reassigning the patient to another cluster. Instead, it reflects how the model supports clinicians by:\n",

    "* using **patient-specific features** for individualized insight, and\n",
    "* allowing **cross-cluster comparison** when a patient’s profile aligns more closely with another cluster’s characteristics.\n",
