    "> This 72-year-old female patient is most consistent with **Cluster 2**, reflecting multi-system morbidity including kidney disease and musculoskeletal risk. Although not assigned to Cluster 1, some preventive cardio-metabolic strategies from Cluster 1 could be considered alongside Cluster 2’s primary management recommendations."

    "This 72-year-old female patient was assigned to **Cluster 2**, characterized by musculoskeletal and respiratory morbidity with metabolic risk. The assignment was primarily driven by the presence of **kidney failure**, which strongly aligns with the cluster’s profile of moderate chronic disease burden, including arthritis and metabolic complications. Functional difficulties were mild but present, consistent with the cluster’s moderate symptomatology. While the patient is nearest to **Cluster 1**, which represents early cardio-metabolic risk with preserved function, the kidney and musculoskeletal comorbidities justify the assignment to Cluster 2. Clinically, this suggests that **management and preventive strategies typical of Cluster 2**—focusing on kidney health, musculoskeletal support, and metabolic monitoring—are most relevant. However, elements of **cardio-metabolic preventive care from Cluster 1** may also be considered to mitigate future cardiovascular risk, allowing a more tailored and proactive care approach."
