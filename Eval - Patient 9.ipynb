    "\n",
    "This patient is assigned to **Cluster 4** because their overall health profile is much closer to the centroid of Cluster 4 in UMAP feature space compared to Cluster 2. The separation ratio of **6.63** indicates a strong and stable cluster assignment. This suggests that Cluster 4 characteristics best describe the patient’s health and risk profile.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The patient is **much further from Cluster 2** (distance = 3.487), which is characterized by lower kidney-related contributions and slightly different metabolic markers.\n",
    "* While Cluster 2 contains features relevant to metabolic risk and steroid-related measurements, the patient’s **kidney-related markers are more aligned with Cluster 4**, supporting their primary assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and Clinical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Recommendation:** Treatments, preventive strategies, and diagnostic approaches suggested for **Cluster 4** are most relevant to this patient.\n",
    "2. **Secondary Consideration:** Due to partial overlap in steroid-related markers with Cluster 2, clinicians may consider monitoring **steroid metabolism or other early metabolic indicators** that are characteristic of Cluster 2 for proactive health management.\n",
    "3. **Overall Conclusion:** The patient’s profile strongly aligns with Cluster 4, but knowledge of Cluster 2 characteristics could inform **early detection and preventive care**, particularly for metabolic and cardiovascular health.\n",
